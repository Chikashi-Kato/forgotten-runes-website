# Welcome to the Cult

# FAQ

## **What is this?**

Forgotten Runes Wizard's Cult is collection of 10k Wizard NFTs. Each Wizard is totally unique and has it's own name. Additionally, all of the Wizard art is fully encoded on-chain.

The World of Forgotten Runes is growing everyday as our Cult contributes art, animation, stories, memes, and lore to social media and to our one-of-a-kind [Book of Lore](/lore).

There is limitless potential in this decentralized approach to world-building. We call it a "Collaborative Legendarium." Most who participate in this world-building experiment join the Cult which starts by owning a Wizard NFT.

## **How do I get a Wizard?**

Our launch sale occurred on June 30th, 2021. The minting price was 0.07 ETH and we sold all 10k Wizards in 28 minutes.

But you can still buy a Wizard from the secondary market on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/forgottenruneswizardscult) or any NFT marketplace.

> TIP: If you are new to NFTs, see [this guide "How to Buy and Sell NFTs on OpenSea"](https://www.inputmag.com/guides/how-to-buy-sell-nfts-on-opensea).
>
> Also, [join our super friendly Discord](https://discord.gg/forgottenrunes) and ask around! Wizards are always ready to help.

## **Why should I become a Wizard?**

Because when you become a Wizard you take part in the co-creation of the stories, Lore, art, and community that is The Forgotten Runes Wizard Cult.

## **What benefits come with owning a Wizard?**

In addition to exclusive membership into our mysterious-but-friendly cult, owning a Wizard NFT gives you access to many other treasures such as full turnarounds and walk cycles of your wizard, [a GM generator](/scenes/gm/7846), airdrops such as our recent ["Sacred Flame" for _Forgotten Souls_](/posts/forgotten-souls) (["Sacred Flame on OpenSea"](https://opensea.io/assets/0x31158181b4b91a423bfdc758fc3bf8735711f9c5/0)), and build out your character in [The Book of Lore](/lore).

We have many more surprises coming to the Cult soon, join us.

## **What should I do once I become a Wizard?**

- Write in [The Book of Lore](/lore)
- Join [a Guild](/posts/guilds)

## **What does it mean to be a Wizard?**

## **Can you talk more about this concept of "decentralized world-building?"**

This blog post explains it in depth, but the top level explanation is that all of our Cult members contribute daily to expanding the world of Forgotten Runes. These contributions come in the form of art, animation, stories, poems, and other media. This work is collected in the Book of Lore, which is an every growing compendium of every Wizard in the collection.

## The Wizard's Summary

The Wizard's Cult is a collaborative legendarium. There are 10,000 unique Wizard NFTs.

The NFT holder is considered the Wizard owner and they hold not only the _image_, but the _character_ of that Wizard.

Wizards create [stories, animations, artwork, poems, and songs](/posts/commissions) about their character and together we're world-building.

The image of each Wizard is 50x50 pixels, scaled to 400x400. Each Wizard has a unique name and configuration of traits. But the Wizard character is so much more than their pixels. Come visit [our community](https://discord.gg/forgottenrunes) and see.

## Acquiring a Wizard

The Summoning began on [Ethereum block 12736300](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/12736300), which was June 30th 2021. The Wizard NFTs are encoded fully on-chain.

Today, the only way to acquire a Wizard is on the secondary market [here on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/forgottenruneswizardscult).

## Provenance: Encoded Fully On-Chain

Most NFT projects merely store their images on IPFS, and the owners of such NFTs only hold a pointer to that image. Not so with us.

Our Wizards are fully encoded on-chain. The provenance of the Wizard images and data are recorded wholly within the Ethereum blockchain, attached to our [custom contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x521f9c7505005cfa19a8e5786a9c3c9c9f5e6f42). Which means ownership of a Wizard, and the image itself, is fully on-chain.

This on-chain provenance puts Wizards in a small cohort of on-chain NFTs including [0xmons](https://0xmons.xyz/) and [Mooncats](https://mooncatrescue.com/).

In short, your Wizard is 100% decentralized and will live forever on the Ethereum blockchain.

## The World and Lore

<ResponsiveImg className="full-bleed" src="/static/img/map/map2.png" />

Ownership of a Forgotten Runes Wizard is adoption of a _character_. Wizards create Lore to tell their stories.

Lore for Wizards can be stored immutably on-chain in our upcoming Book of Lore (September 2021).

> If you'd like to have someone create Lore for you -- or offer to create Lore for others -- [see the commissions page here](/posts/commissions)

## Roadmap

You can find more information about [our roadmap on this page](/posts/roadmap).

# Q: Tell me more about on-chain encoding?

Unlike most other NFT projects, Forgotten Rune's Wizards are fully encoded on-chain. This means that they do not depend on any external or centralized hosting service to exist.

We do not wish to leak the attributes of the Wizards before the Summoning has started, therefore, the Decoding Ring (script) for generating the Wizards from on-chain data will be released on Github 96 hours after The Summoning has begun.

The technical among you might notice that we do host a mirror of our images and data on IPFS and centralized services. This is only a mirror and is for convenience of tools like OpenSea and not requirement for the provenance or persistence of the Wizards.

# Q: Tell me more about the commercial rights?

Forgotten Runes will grant Wizard NFT owners non-exclusive commercial rights to the image in their NFT. That said, commercial rights are an involved, nuanced, and even regional topic and we will outline more the specifics of these rights in September 2021.

# Q: Where can I learn more about the Wizards?

Head over to our other [blog posts](/posts) to learn [how to get commissions made](/posts/commissions), the [roadmap](/posts/roadmap), how to [find our murals](/posts/murals), and much, much more.

# Special Thanks

We'd like to offer our thanks to our beta testers and folks who gave us feedback early in the project. We especially want to thank [Owen (0xmons)](https://twitter.com/0xmons) for his guidance and technical feedback on the project.
