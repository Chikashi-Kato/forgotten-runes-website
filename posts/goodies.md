There are actually several methods to access these elements.

### **The Book of Lore method**

When flipping through the book of Lore, you’ll notice 4 icons in the bottom left. For the purposes of this guide, we'll focus on the GM and the Download button. In this example, we are using Wizard #1945, Mystic Silas of Xanadu.

Clicking on the GM button will display Mystic Silas saying GM.

To use this on your social media, simply take a screengrab of it! You can also drag and drop these elements to your desktop. Now be sure to post this to all your Twitter followers when you wake up! (If you don't know, “GM” is a popular top-of-the-morning greeting in the NFT space.)

The Download Icon will give you a zip file containing all the pixel art for the Wizard. You’ll get the Wizards separate parts (head, body, familiar, prop, etc), the Wizard with transparent background, a sepia toned version of the Wizard, and a full turnaround of the Wizard. In the future, the Wizard walk cycles will appear here too.

Additionally, you’ll receive 3 different resolutions of the Wizard: 50x50, 400x400, and 1024x1024. The 50x50 are the easiest to edit in a pixel editor like [Aseprite or Photoshop](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/posts/how-to-use-aseprite-for-wizards), but the larger resolutions are easier to display on Twitter or other social media. You can also edit the 50x50, and then enlarge them before export. (In Photoshop, be sure to enlarge with [Nearest Neighbor](https://www.hipsthetic.com/enlarge-pixel-art-without-blurring-in-photoshop/)).

### **The Gallery method**

There is a gallery of all 10k Wizards on the website, sitting right under the Book of Lore. Many of these Wizards do not have Lore written about them yet, but you can still access their parts. Simply click on one to access the download button.

### **The URL method**

Maybe the easiest way to access these elements is to simply copy paste [this URL](https://www.forgottenrunes.com/lore/wizards/1945):

`https://www.forgottenrunes.com/lore/wizards/1945`

into the URL bar. The only trick here is you’ll need to know the serial number of the Wizard you want to access. The above example is for Wizard number 1945, but if you want a different number, replace the 1945 with the desired number. So if you want Wizard #32, simply put
`https://www.forgottenrunes.com/lore/wizards/32` into the URL bar.

In the future, we plan to make more user friendly tools to access your Wizards art. And we will certainly be adding to this folder of goodies. In the meantime, have fun with this extra Wizard artwork. We can’t wait to see what you make with it!
